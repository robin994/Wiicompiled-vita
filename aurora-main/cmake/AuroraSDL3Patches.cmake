# Source-level fixes applied to the vendored SDL3 tree before it is built.

# Each patch is an exact string replacement, checked and idempotent: a tree that
# already carries the fix is left alone, a tree where the anchor text is missing
# (a different SDL version) stops the configure with a clear message instead of
# silently building without the fix.
#
# Used two ways:
#   - included by AuroraSDL3Provider.cmake, which calls aurora_sdl3_apply_patches()
#     on a pre-provided source tree (FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_SDL);
#   - run as `cmake -DSDL_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P AuroraSDL3Patches.cmake` from the
#     FetchContent PATCH_COMMAND for a freshly extracted tarball.

  # Wii Remote: rebuild the joystick in place after an extension change.
  #
  # When a Nunchuk or Classic Controller is plugged in or pulled out, the driver
  # flags the joystick as disconnected so it can come back with the new name and
  # capabilities. But the HID device stays open, and HIDAPI only removes a
  # joystick-less device once its handle is closed, so nothing ever re-creates
  # the joystick: the remote is gone for good until the application toggles the
  # driver hint (which closes and re-opens the Bluetooth HID handle, something
  # some Windows Bluetooth stacks answer by dropping the link). Instead, when the
  # device has no joystick, probe the extension again (two bounded attempts, at
  # most once a second) and connect a new joystick on the still-open handle.
